<p>This project has been developed for <a href=https://de.masterschool.com/>MasterSchool's</a> November 2024 Hackathon by Power Rangers (group 2):</p>

<ul>
    <li>Gabo Oscar</li>
    <li>Hieu Dang</li>
    <li>Marina</li>
    <li>Timothy</li>
    <li>VeronicaLobos</li>
</ul>

<p>For this project we are required to create a CLI app with python, with a text game. The game will use the <a href=https://pypi.org/project/Wikipedia-API/>Wikipedia-API</a>, and we need to collaborate (for the first time!) with our classmates to create it.</p>

## Objectives

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p><strong>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[✔] Have fun:</strong></p>
<p>Hackathons are exciting, funny, and creative. It’s another reminder that coding could be so much fun!</p>
<p><strong>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[✔] Learn how to collaborate in a team:</strong></p>
<p>Collaboration is a crucial skill in the job market, and hackathons are your main opportunity to practice working effectively and communicating with others in real life. This goal is more important than winning or writing the best code.</p>
<p><strong>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[✔] Create something real from scratch:</strong></p>
<p>Hackathons are a great chance to write a real application that people can use, from scratch.</p>

## Guidelines

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p><strong>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[✔] Don't hesitate to seek help</strong></p>
<p>Hackathons can be very confusing and intense. If you feel lost or uncomfortable in your group, don't hesitate to reach out to your group leader or mentor immediately. Hackathons should be enjoyable and educational experiences, not intimidating ones.</p>
<p><strong>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[✔] Prioritize teamwork</strong></p>
<p>Hackathons are all about teamwork. It's more important to collaborate effectively with your teammates than to write the best piece of code. Respect your teammates, fulfill your responsibilities, and offer support to those who may need it.</p>
<p><strong>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;[✔] Be mindful of your peers</strong></p>
<p>Refrain from taking on tasks outside your role, such as completing someone else's code for them. Focus on fostering a positive and inclusive team dynamic.</p>
