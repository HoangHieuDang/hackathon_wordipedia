1.  A "number of players" will be input.

2.  All the players will be requested to input their "names".

3.  All the players receive the same "random word" 
    and "initial Wikipedia article" page.

4.  There will be 1-3 rounds. In each round the players will
    either choose to "stay" at that Wikipedia page, or to 
    "skip" to another Wikipedia article:

    - If the player chooses to "stay" (1) at that Wikipedia
    article, they will wait until the other players are
    finished.
    - If the player chooses to "skip" (2) to the next round,
    they will be able to choose an index number from a 
    randomly generated list of Wikipedia articles.

5.  The game will end when every player has either chosen to:
    - "stay" in the first option/round
    - "skip" in the first option/round, and stay in the second
    - "skip" two time, and "stay" by default in the third option

6.  The number of occurrences of the given random word will be
    calculated across all player’s Wikipedia article of their
    choice.

7.  The winner with the highest occurrence of the given word
    will then be announced!
